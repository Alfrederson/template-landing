        <h2>Environmental Friendliness</h2>
        <p>
            R718 is a truly eco-friendly refrigerant
            with zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and an ultra-low global
            warming potential (GWP). By using R718, you can significantly reduce
            your carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change.
        </p>
        <h2>Safety and Non-Toxicity</h2>
        <p>
            As R718 is chemically similar to water, it is
            non-toxic and non-flammable, ensuring a safe working environment for
            your operations. It eliminates the risks associated with traditional
            refrigerants and offers peace of mind to both manufacturers and
            end-users.
        </p>
        <h2>Wide Range of Applications</h2>
